## mingw-w64-texmacs : for building the latest TeXmacs in MSys2/Mingw32 environment

when running `makepkg`, this will build TeXmacs for Windows from latest svn and package it with utilities not found in the official distribution: 

- a spell checker (with dictionary for English and the locale of the machine where the build is made)

- extra image utilities enabling to use TeXmacs as an equation editor for Inkscape and LibreOffice (using this [LO extension](https://github.com/slowphil/SVG_and_TeXmacs_for_LibreOffice)).


The easiest way to build TeXmacs is by using the [fully automated build environment](https://github.com/slowphil/texmacs-win-builder) ([direct download](https://github.com/slowphil/texmacs-win-builder/releases/download/0.91/texmacs-win-sdk-installer-0.91.7z.exe))
